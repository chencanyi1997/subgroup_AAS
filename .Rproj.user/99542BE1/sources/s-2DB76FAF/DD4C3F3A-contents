## Introduction 

Biological heterogeneity is common in many diseases; heterogeneity comsplicates clinical management, as it is often the main reason for prognostic and therapeutic failures. And modern medical technology, e.g., MRI, Microfluidics, Genechip, often produce tremendous amount of massive data scattered across various places. Due to many reasons such as memory and storage limitaion, transmission capacity, privacy issue and ethics concerns, we can not fuse all the data in one place in common. In this project, we aim to provide a data-driven communication-efficient approach to find the subgroup pattern after ajusting the common covariances in a distributed setting. Moreover, we allow for the number of dimesion $p$ diverge.

Several authors have studied the problem of exploring homogeneous effects of covariates in the regression setting by assumption that the true coefficients are divided into several cluseters with common values (see, e.g., Tib, Bondell, Huang). All the above methods utilized the pairwise penalty. Desplit of its well performance when $n$ is small, it is computationally impossible when sample size $n$ grows to infinity. The number of parameters would be at least $O({n^2})$. For the distributed setting, most methods adopt the ADMM manner, which put severe restriction in the number of machine. Technically, the number of machine $L$ should be the order $O(\sqrt{n})$, where $n$ is the total sample size. Moreover, ADMM is in essential a first order method suffering the slow convergence rate.

### Problems
* Is whether some subgroup pattern existing in the survival time after adjusting the convariate?
* How many subgroups are in this dataset?

## Model
In this project, we consider the following model:

$$
Y_{i,j} = \mu_{i,j} + x_{i,j}^T\beta + \epsilon_{i,j}, i = 1,\cdots,m,j = 1,\cdots,L.
$$
And the data is scattered across $L$ machines with $m=n/L$ samples in each machine.

## ALgorithm
1. Apply distributed lasso to get an estimate for $\beta$.
2. Apply kmeans.
3. Revise the distributed lasso to get an estimate for $\beta$.
4. Apply kmeans.
5. Check stop criterion or Go to 3.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

### About Data
Publicly available lung cancer genomic data from the Chemores Cohort Study. This data is part of an integrated study of mRNA, miRNA and clinical variables to characterize the molecular distinctions between squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and adenocarcinoma (AC) in Non Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) aside large cell lung carcinoma (LCC). Tissue samples were analysed from a cohort of 123 patients, who underwent complete surgical resection at the Institut Mutualiste Montsouris (Paris, France) between 30 January 2002 and 26 June 2006. The studied outcome was the "Disease-Free Survival Time". Patients were followed until the first relapse occurred or administrative censoring. In this genomic dataset, the expression levels of Agilent miRNA probes (p=939) were included from the n=123 cohort samples. The miRNA data contains normalized expression levels. See below the paper by Lazar et al. (2013) and Array Express data repository for complete description of the samples, tissue preparation, Agilent array technology, and data normalization. In addition to the genomic data, five clinical variables, also evaluated on the cohort samples, are included as continuous variable ('Age') and nominal variables ('Type','KRAS.status','EGFR.status','P53.status'). Data is available [here](http://fafner.meb.ki.se/personal/yudpaw/?page_id=11).

### Load Data
```{r}
load("Chemores-clindat-public-Apr2014.RData")
load("Chemores-GE-log2TumorNormal-2011feb08.RData")
load("Chemores-miRNA-LVS-normalized.RData")
load("Agilent-gnames.RData")
```

```{r eda}
head(Real.2[,1:10])
tail(Real.2[,1:10])
dim(Real.2)
str(Real.2[,1:10])
summary(Real.2[,1:10])
(colSums(Real.2==0)/ncol(Real.2))[1:10] ## zero-inflate effect
missmap(Real.2)

vals <- unique(scales::rescale(c(volcano)))
o <- order(vals, decreasing = FALSE)
cols <- scales::col_numeric("Blues", domain = NULL)(vals)
colz <- setNames(data.frame(vals[o], cols[o]), NULL)

heatmap(apply(Real.2, 2, as.numeric))
## plot_ly(z=apply(Real.2, 2, as.numeric), colorscale = colz, type = "heatmap") ## %>% 
##   layout(title = "Heatmap of miRNA",
##          xaxis = list(title = "Gene"))
```

```{r}
x <- Real.2[,-c(1)] %>% apply(2, as.numeric)
y <- Real.2$y
cvfit <- cv.glmnet(x,y)
plot(cvfit)
beta <- coef(cvfit,s="lambda.min")
beta <- beta[2:length(beta)]
yhat <- x%*%beta
res = y - x %*% beta
res = res %>% as.data.frame
colnames(res) = "ires"
ggplot(res, aes(x = ires, y = ..density..)) + 
  geom_histogram(fill = "cornsilk", colour = "grey60", size = 0.2)+ geom_density() + xlim(-2, 1)
```
We can find two modes in the density plot. Thus, we apply kmeans to the residual.

```{r}
cl <- kmeans(res,2)
res$cluster <- cl$cluster
res1 <- res %>% as.data.frame() %>% filter(cl$cluster==1)
res2 <- res %>% as.data.frame() %>% filter(cl$cluster==2) 
ggplot(res, aes(x = ires, y= ..density.., color = cluster, group = cluster))+
    geom_histogram()+
    geom_density(adjust=1.5) +
    facet_wrap(~cluster) +
    theme(
      legend.position="none",
      panel.spacing = unit(0.1, "lines"),
      axis.ticks.x=element_blank()
    )

ggplot(res, aes(x = ires, color = cluster, group = cluster))+
    geom_boxplot() +
  coord_flip()
```

At this time, the distribution within each subgoup is more homogeneous.

```{r}
t.test(res1$ires,res2$ires)
```

T test is significant.
